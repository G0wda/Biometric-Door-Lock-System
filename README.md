# ESP32 Fingerprint Attendance & Logging System  

This project is a **biometric attendance/logging system** built using an **ESP32** microcontroller and an **R307 fingerprint sensor**.  
It allows fingerprint **enrollment, validation, listing, and deletion**, while also logging every authentication event to a **remote server** with timestamps.  

---

## üìå Overview  

- ESP32 connects to WiFi and syncs real-time clock via NTP.  
- Users can interact with the fingerprint sensor via the **Serial Menu**.  
- Fingerprints are stored in the **R307 sensor‚Äôs flash database**.  
- Logs (with user ID, action, and timestamp) are sent to a **Flask/Python backend** or any API endpoint.  

---

## üöÄ Features  

- Fingerprint enrollment (manual ID or auto-assign).  
- Fingerprint validation (sends log to server if match is found).  
- Delete single fingerprint or reset entire database.  
- List all enrolled fingerprints.  
- Time synchronization via NTP (Indian Standard Time UTC+5:30).  
- REST API logging with JSON.  
- Works with ESP32‚Äôs WiFi + HTTPClient libraries.

## üõ† Hardware Requirements  

- ESP32 Development Board  
- R307 Fingerprint Sensor  
- Breadboard + Jumper Wires  
- (Optional) Buzzer/LED for success/failure feedback

## üîå Wiring  

| R307 Sensor Pin | ESP32 Pin | Description |  
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|  
| VCC (5V)        | 5V        | Power       |  
| GND             | GND       | Ground      |  
| TX              | GPIO 16   | Data to ESP32 |  
| RX              | GPIO 17   | Data from ESP32 |  

‚ö†Ô∏è R307 works on 3.3V logic. ESP32 GPIO pins are safe for direct connection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration  

Edit the following values in the code before uploading:  

```cpp
const char* ssid = "your-SSID";         // WiFi SSID
const char* password = "your-PASSWORD"; // WiFi Password
const char* serverName = "http://<SERVER_IP>:5000/logs"; // API Endpoint
